# Amo Moloko - @AmoDinho 🧜‍♂️

<hr/>

Yo 🤙 I'm Amogelang, usually people call me Amo. I'm a fullstack engineer. I love using JavaScript to build whatever I can imagine. 

I'm big on learning how to integrate bleedging edge tech that improves my developer experince into my `production` workflows, in the fastest way possible. 

Big believer in learning how to do difficult things and then replicating them at speed in a simple and sustainable manner. 🧁 As well as putting everything I learn on the job out in the open for the community to benefit from.

const opinion = "If you can't read and understand other programming languages you're a suspect dev"
const unpopularOpinion = () => console.log(opinion)

unpopularOpinion()
