# Amo Moloko - @AmoDinho 🧜‍♂️

<hr/>

Yo 🤙 ! I'm Amogelang, usually people call me Amo. I love using JavaScript to build whatever I can imagine.

## 😎 What I do currently?

I'm a fullstack engineer at [Tripplo](https://tripplo.co/), helping to shape the movement of road freight across Sub-Saharan Africa. 🚚  I am also a co-organizer of [Front-end Development South Africa (FEDSA)](https://fedsa.org/), which is an NPO that aims to share expertise around Front-end knowledge with South Africa's tech community. 🤝

I'm big on learning how to integrate bleedging edge tech that improves my developer experince into my `production` workflows, in the fastest way possible. 

Big believer in learning how to do difficult things and then replicating them at speed in a simple and sustainable manner. 🧁 As well as putting everything I learn on the job out in the open for the community to benefit from. 


## 🧨 What do I use to get the job done ?

* React
* Vue
* GraphQL
* Jest
* Testing library
* AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, SES, SNS, SQS,S3)
* Netlify
* Seed
* Design Systems
* My brain to think about problems deeply
* A positive mindset
* Hunger/desire (helps to ship small iterative chunks of work 🐐).
